# Sales-and-Customer-Insights-Dashboard

This project analyzes retail sales data to generate actionable insights using Excel and Power BI. It focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs), customer behavior, sales trends, and customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The goal is to help the business identify top-performing products, customer value, and opportunities for growth and retention.

# Tools Used
Excel – Data cleaning, KPI calculations, Pivot analysis
Power BI – Dashboard design, Data modeling, Interactive visuals

# Key Features
* Sales Performance KPIs: Total Sales, Profit, Orders, Quantity, Avg Discount
* Time-Based Analysis: Monthly and yearly trends of sales and profit
* Category & Segment Breakdown: Visual analysis by Category, Sub-category, Customer Segment

*Customer Insights:*
* Top/Bottom Customers
* Region-wise performance
* Category-wise profitability
* RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment customers



# Business Insights
* High sales concentration in few customer segments
* Discounts negatively impact profit margins
* Frequent buyers are not always the most valuable (RFM helped identify)
* Some categories generate high quantity but low profit → optimization possible

 # Outcome
* Created an executive-level dashboard that offers clear, data-backed decision-making.
* Helped simulate how a business analyst would guide sales strategy using data.
